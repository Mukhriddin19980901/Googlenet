Inception1model
The code defines a custom GoogleNet-like model called GoogleNet_2 using TensorFlow/Keras. This model is designed for image classification tasks and is structured using various Inception modules. It also includes two classifier branches (class_1 and class_2) for multi-branch classification. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Model Initialization: The GoogleNet_2 class is initialized with the input shape and the number of output classes (classes). It also defines the name of the model.

Model Architecture:

The model starts with a series of convolutional, batch normalization, and ReLU layers to process the input data.
It then includes max-pooling layers to downsample the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
The Inception modules (inception_layer) are used to capture features at different scales and complexities.
After the Inception modules, there are classifier layers (classifier_layer) connected to different Inception stages (inception_4a and inception_4d).
The model ends with additional layers, including batch normalization, ReLU activation, average pooling, dropout, and a dense (fully connected) layer for classification.
Model Building:

The GoogleNet_2 class builds three separate models:
inception_model: The main model that produces the final output.
class_1: A classifier model connected to one of the Inception stages (inception_4a).
class_2: A classifier model connected to another Inception stage (inception_4d).
call Method: The call method specifies how data should flow through the model. It takes an input tensor x and passes it through the inception_model, class_1, and class_2, returning the outputs of each.

Model Outputs: The model produces three outputs:

The inception_model output, representing the final features.
The class_1 output, which is a classification result based on one of the Inception stages.
The class_2 output, which is another classification result based on a different Inception stage.
Overall, this code defines a complex neural network architecture that combines features from different Inception stages and provides multiple classification results. Keep in mind that configuring and training this model will require specifying a loss function, optimizer, and dataset, as well as conducting the training process.
